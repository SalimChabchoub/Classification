# 🧠 Classification & Clustering – Python Notebook

This repository contains a classification and clustering project done as part of an academic lab work.

The goal was to explore various **machine learning algorithms** to perform **classification** on a labeled dataset and analyze the performance of each model.

## 📚 Project Objectives

- 📊 Preprocessing and visualization of the dataset
- 🤖 Classification using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- 🌀 Clustering with KMeans
- 📈 Evaluation of models (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn` (`sklearn`)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/classification-tp.git
    cd classification-tp
    ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/classification-tp.git
    cd classification-tp
   ```
3. Run all cells

## 🧪 Results
Each model is evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
The results are compared to highlight the best-performing classifier for the dataset.
